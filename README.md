# 🏠 U.S. Housing Affordability: Then and Now

This project analyzes trends in U.S. housing affordability over time by integrating multiple datasets and building clear, data-driven visualizations.

## 📌 Overview
The goal was to study how housing affordability has changed across different **regions**, **income brackets**, and **housing types**.  
We standardized timeframes using Python (Pandas) and created Tableau dashboards to highlight disparities in affordability.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning and integration  
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- **Data Sources:** Income datasets, cost of living, construction rates, down payment timelines (9+ datasets)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Regional affordability gaps have widened over the last decade  
- Down payment timelines have increased significantly for lower income groups  
- Visualizations make longitudinal comparisons easy and narrative-driven

## 🚀 What’s Included
- Project description and data overview  
- Tableau dashboard screenshots (coming soon)
